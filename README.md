A simple list of items with insert/delete funcionalities in a tabbed activity.

The List uses a HashMap to allow the items to have a associated title and description, by selecting a item the user 
can see the title and description in a new activity.
The insert funcionality uses a dialog box with simple checking for fields that were not informed and the delete 
funcionality uses a long press with a confirmation dialog box
The second tab only display some fields (name/phone/mail) for the user to insert and a send mail button that 
checks for correct mail pattern and then opens a list of applications that the user can use to send the email.
